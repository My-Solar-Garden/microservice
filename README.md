# Plants Microservice
This Sinatra application serves as a microservice for [My Solar Garden](https://solar-garden-fe.herokuapp.com/), an application for tracking your garden's health and measuring its carbon impacts. It collects plant data by requesting information from the [Harvest Helper API](https://github.com/damwhit/harvest_helper).

Although parsnips are biennials, they are usually grown as an annual vegetable. Parsnips are a hardy, cool-season crop that is best harvested after a hard frost. Parsnips are not only tasty in soups and stews, but can also be enjoyed by themselves.",

        "transplanting": "Thin or transplant seedlings to stand 3-6 inches apart.",
